<h2>What is this site?</h2>
<p>I've started this site to learn how to build a website and for a place to keep my thoughts, feelings and ideas in one place</p>

<p>I've been trying to learn quite a few things all in one go, it's workign out terribly, so this is a new attempt, based on the idea of habit stacking. We'll see how we get on</p>
<p>I've been using a cross between iOS, windows and macOS over the years, but never really settled on anythign. I'm pretty sure that this isn't going to change, but I'm going to be thowing more of my lot into Windows and see where I get to, trying to use cross platform bits where possible. I'm not gonna lie, I'm coming across a few problems in this regard.</p>

<p>So I now have this site up on a site, which I have to say I'm pretty pleased about. I mean, it's not hard, but it made sense and it worked.</p>

<p> I can even update from the iPad, using working copy. Every step is tricky, but, strangly enough, there's a website called Google which is suprisingly useful, thanks to many good folk.</p>
