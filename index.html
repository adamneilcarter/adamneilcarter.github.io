  <h2>What is this site?</h2>
  <p>I've started this site to learn how to build a website and for a place to keep my thoughts, feelings and ideas in one place</p>

  <p>I've been trying to learn quite a few things all in one go, it's workign out terribly, so this is a new attempt, based on the idea of habit stacking. We'll see how we get on</p>
  <p>I've been using a cross between iOS, windows and macOS over the years, but never really settled on anythign. I'm pretty sure that this isn't going to change, but I'm going to be thowing more of my lot into Windows and see where I get to, trying to use cross platform bits where possible. I'm not gonna lie, I'm coming across a few problems in this regard.</p>

<div class="hero">
  <p>So I now have this site up and <strong>working</strong>, which I have to say I'm pretty pleased about. I mean, it's not hard, but it made sense and it worked.</p>

  <p> I can even update from the iPad, using working copy. Every step is tricky, but, strangly enough, there's a website called Google which is suprisingly useful, thanks to many good folk.</p>

  <h3>Trying new things</h3>
  <p> I tried to put in a carosel. pretty hard to understand. I'm not giving up though, but I may go a little slower and build up to it</p>

<h3>Developing people</h3>

<p>I think people missunderstand motivation. Motivation comes from inside you. Making a difference makes me want to get out of bed and do a good job. My boss making my office nicer may give a short hit, but doesn't give me long term enthusiasm for my work.</p>

<H3>Making changes</H3>
<p>Should we be going for big changes, or small ones? Putting your reseources behind big projects can make big step changes. Small ones can be completed more easily and create a culture of improvements. It needs pondering and testing</p>

<h3>Trying new things</h3>
<p>I'm trying Skillshare at the moment to try and see what I can learn over the next two months. I'm hoping to make improvents to the site as I learn them</p>
