<h2>What is this site?</h2>
<p>I've started this site to learn how to build a website and for a place to keep my thoughts, feelings and ideas in one place</p>

<p>I've been trying to learn quite a few things all in one go, it's workign out terribly, so this is a new attempt, based on the idea of habit stacking. We'll see how we get on</p>
<p>I've been using a cross between iOS, windows and macOS over the years, but never really settled on anythign. I'm pretty sure that this isn't going to change, but I'm going to be thowing more of my lot into Windows and see where I get to, trying to use cross platform bits where possible</p>
